            <strong>CHEMICAL PEEL TREATMENT</strong>- <br\>A chemical peel is a technique used to improve and smooth the texture of the skin.
            Facial skin is mostly treated, and scarring can be improved.
            Chemical peels are intended to remove the outermost layers 
            of the skin. To accomplish this task, the chosen peel solution induces a controlled injury to the skin. 
            Resulting wound healing processes begin to regenerate new tissues.
            <highlight style="color:red">The dead skin eventually peels off.</highlight>The regenerated skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin. 
            Some types of chemical peels can be purchased and administered without a medical license; however, people are advised to seek professional help from a dermatologist or plastic surgeon on a specific type of chemical peel before a procedure is performed.

           <strong>α-Hydroxy Acid Peels</strong> Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are naturally occurring carboxylic acids such as 
           glycolic acid, a natural constituent of sugar cane juice, and lactic acid, 
           found in sour milk and tomato juice as well as being produced endogenously 
           during normal metabolism and exercise.[3] This is the mildest of the peel formulas 
           and produces light peels for <highlight style="color:red">treatment of fine wrinkles, 
            areas of dryness, uneven pigmentation and acne</highlight>Alpha hydroxy acids can also be mixed with facial washes, serums or creams in lesser concentrations as part of a daily skin-care regimen to improve the skin's texture.

        <strong>ACNE THERAPY</strong>
        <p>
            Acne blue light therapy works by targeting the bacteria that causes acne.
             Moderate acne that has not responded to other facial skin care treatments can be treated with this light-based therapy, 
             which is administered over a span of several weeks. Acne blue light therapy rarely causes side effects, and does not damage skin.
             <highlight style="color:red">Intense Pulsed Light (IPL™)</highlight> is a facial rejuvenation treatment that can be used to address the effects of sun damage, heredity, and aging on facial skin. Skin imperfections such as wrinkles, uneven pigmentation, freckles, rosacea, facial veins, 
             brown spots, and enlarged pores can be eliminated or greatly improved withIPL™ Photofacial treatments.
             There is no “downtime” after the procedure — you can return immediately to your normal daily activities after your IPL™ Photofacial treatment.

            Killing the bacteria that grow in the blocked follicles. This can be done by ingesting antibiotic medication, 
            or by putting antibiotics on the skin. Antibiotics act quickly and are a powerful way of temporarily getting rid of acne. When the body develops a resistance to the antibiotics, the bacteria returns stronger than before.
            Removing oil on the skin can be done by taking <highlight style="color:crimson">drugs that contain Vitamin A.</highlight> Accutane is the name of the most famous treatment using massive quantities of Vitamin A.

            COLLAGEN INDUCTION THERAPY

        <p>
            <strong>COLLAGEN THERAPY - (CIT)  </strong> -  Collagen Induction Therapy (CIT), is a new minimally-invasive skin rejuvenation treatment designed to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as scars on the face and body.
            The Collagen Induction Therapy treatment uses tiny needles on a medical-grade dermal pen that is moved over the skin to create tiny, evenly-spaced puncture wounds on the skin. Small needle clusters on a hand held device penetrate into the skin and break up old collagen strands and stimulate the production of elastin fibres oriented from the deep layers of the dermis to the surface.
            The result is <highlight style="color:red">smoother, thicker, tighter, more even toned skin. </highlight>
            This process stimulates the body’s natural collagen production by generating a “wound healing” response. The pen used is much like a fine tattooing needle, so should cause minimal trauma when creating the microscopic punctures in the skin. However, topical local anaesthetic is used to minimise discomfort. By wounding the skin you encourage the body to produce new collagen and elastin, which helps it thicken and ‘plump up’. 
            The procedure can be performed on the face and body.
        </p>
        <P>
                IT does not damage the skin… it leaves the epidermis (which is the protective layer of our skin) intact.
            Collagen Induction Therapy is suitable for all skin types, and ideal candidates are those who wish to improve skin laxity, smooth lines and wrinkles, slow the onset of the ageing process or improve the appearance of scarring from acne, also helps to strengthen weakened capillary walls that cause diffused redness (rosacea).
            You will need to wait for six month if you have been using any of the Accutane family.
